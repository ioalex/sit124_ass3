    <h2>INTRODUCTION TO WEBSITE</h2>
    <p class="writeup">This implementation plan was created as a proposed solution to Ms Belinda Batesâ€™ request for
         the development of a website. The purpose of this website is to inform the community about new and 
         emerging technology, as well as technology which is shaping the workplace of the future. The website will be developed
         in HTML, CSS & JavaScript. These technologies will enable the development team to create a responsive and dynamic website that can display 
         multimedia content, incorporate interactive features, and provide a seamless user experience.
